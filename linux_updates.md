# Linux Basics Lab – Notes

### 23/08/25 – Day 1: Shell Basics
- Commands: `echo`, `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`
- Installed a package with `sudo apt install`
- Viewed processes with `htop`

### 24/08/25 – Day 2: Navigation
- Commands: `touch`, `ls -l`, `cat`
- Shortcuts:  
  - `..` → parent directory  
  - `.` → current directory  
  - `~` → home directory  
  - `-` → previous directory  
- Used `clear` to reset terminal

### 25/08/25 – Day 3: Scripting
- Created first Bash script using `nano`
- Scripts must start with a shebang: `#!/bin/bash`
- Made script executable with `chmod +x filename`
- Troubleshooting:  
  - Single quotes `'...'` → literal text  
  - Double quotes `"..."` → variable expansion  
  - `[ ]` requires spaces around operators  
- Practiced loops and conditional statements
- Learned to comment as you script → helps track progress
